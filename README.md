- File trainwindow.rspag is a prototype project which contain full-fledged working simulation of fixing a glass to a train window by calculating it's angle and position. 

- File carsuspension.rspag is a prototype project tested on IRB-7600 Industrial Robot after performing some basic mathematical operation. 

- File welding.rspag is also a prototype project tested on IRB-7600 Industrial Robot where a welding gun is used to weld with the help of Line sensor.
